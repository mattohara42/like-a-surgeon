# ASSUMPTIONS

Every decision made without asking. Append, do not rewrite.

## Seeded at project start

- **A1.** Date range runs from roughly 1950, not 1962. The dub, funk, and
  electronic spines need the earlier decade to make sense.
- **A2.** Machines are first-class nodes rather than edge metadata, because for
  large stretches of this history the machine is the protagonist.
- **A3.** All audio is synthesized in-browser. No licensed recordings, ever.
  This is a legal constraint that becomes binding the day the project is hosted.
- **A4.** Hero imagery is procedurally generated from palette plus abstract SVG
  motif. Same reason as A3.
- **A5.** Layout is a left-to-right time axis with lineage lanes. Force-directed
  layout is rejected because it destroys chronological reading.
- **A6.** Data is sharded into many small files with a manifest, so that dataset
  growth is linear in effort and does not require re-architecture.
- **A7.** The `file://` fetch restriction is solved with a stdlib-only dev
  server plus a bundling step for release, rather than by abandoning the offline
  requirement.
- **A8.** The 303 AudioWorklet voice is ported from the SQUELCH project rather
  than written fresh.
- **A9.** M1 dataset targets (120 artists, 350 edges) are a first checkpoint,
  not a ceiling. Track D has no ceiling.

## Added after Q1 to Q3 were resolved

- **A10.** Registers differ in vocabulary and sentence length only, never in
  which facts are present. This is a content rule with teeth: it means the Kid
  pass cannot quietly drop the political material when it eventually happens.
- **A11.** The reading-level selector reads available registers from the data
  rather than hardcoding two, so the Kid pass does not require a UI change.
- **A12.** Inclusion of historically important but indefensible artists is
  handled by writing discipline in the `hook` field rather than by a data flag.
  Revisit if the writing proves insufficient.

## Added during M1 architecture planning (docs/m1-architecture.md)

- **A13.** Artist, machine, scene, and label ids share one uniqueness
  namespace rather than one namespace per folder, since an edge's `from`/`to`
  can be any of the four with no type tag alongside it. Enforced by the
  validator as a hard error on collision.
- **A14.** `keyProducers` keeps its current flat array of "artist ids or
  plain names" for now rather than moving to a discriminated
  `{ref}`/`{name}` shape. The validator treats an unresolved entry as a
  warning, not an error, since the schema explicitly allows plain names.
  Revisit if that warning proves noisy once real batches land — cheap to fix
  now, expensive to migrate later.
- **A15.** A record's filename must equal its own `id` field exactly.
  Disagreement is a hard validator error, not a warning.
- **A16.** (Restates A13 in validator terms.) Duplicate-id checking covers
  the shared artist/machine/scene/label namespace, and separately the edge,
  demo, and thread id spaces.
- **A17.** A thread step object must have exactly one of `nodeId`/`edgeId`,
  never both or neither. Implicit in the seed's usage, made explicit here.
- **A18.** `tools/bundle.js`'s output (`data.bundle.js`) is a classic script
  that assigns to `window.LINEAGE_DATA`, not an ES module with `export`.
  Chrome (and others) apply CORS checks to module loads, and `file://`
  origins fail that check the same way `fetch()` does; a classic
  `<script src>` tag is not subject to it. This is the one deliberate
  exception to `CLAUDE.md`'s "ES modules" rule, scoped to the data payload
  only.
- **A19.** `tools/validate.js` validates the sharded `data/` tree via
  `data/manifest.json`, never `data/seed.json`. The seed is a frozen
  reference copy, not live data.

## Added after Q4 to Q8 were resolved

- **A20.** The version-stamp UI from Q4 ships at M3 (reading surface),
  alongside the confidence legend rather than earlier, since neither is
  useful until there's a real reading surface to put it on.
- **A21.** Q5 (repo name, public from the start) taken as answered by the
  repository's own existing state (`mattohara42/like-a-surgeon`, public)
  rather than asked directly, since re-asking a question the filesystem
  already answers would be theater. Flagged in `QUESTIONS.md` in case that
  reading is wrong.
- **A22.** Q8's "give machines/scenes/labels a lineage field" resolved to
  specifics: `machine.lineage`, `scene.lineage`, and `label.lineage` use the
  same enum as `artist.lineage` (`"rock" | "electronic" | "hiphop" | "dub" |
  "funk" | "other"`) and are required, representing the node's editorial
  "home" lineage rather than a computed genealogy. `edge.crossLineage` is
  computed as `fromNode.lineage !== toNode.lineage`, resolving `from`/`to`
  through whichever of the four node types they name. `tools/validate.js`
  checks the stored boolean against that computation and treats a mismatch
  as a hard error, since it's now a real derived value, not an editorial
  claim.
